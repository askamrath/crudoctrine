<p>Throughout the course of this study, we will primarily be focusing on Systematic theology. But, here's a rundown of the different types of theological study:</p>

<p><b>Exegesis</b> &#8211; The process of seeking to determine the correct meaning out of a particular passage of Scripture.</p>

<p><b>Biblical theology</b> &#8211; The process of synthesizing doctrinal statements from a limited selection of scripture - a passage, a book, etc.</p>

<p><b>Doctrinal Theology</b> &#8211; A systematic arrangement of the Bible's teaching on a specific topic. (Example: the "doctrine of Christ" would be a logical and orderly presentation of everything the Scripture says about Christ.)</p>

<p><b>Systematic theology</b> &#8211; The gathering and systematizing of truth about God from any and every source.</p>

<p><b>Historical theology</b> &#8211; The study of how believers in different eras of the history of the church have understood various theological topics.</p>

<p><b>Philosophical theology</b> &#8211; The study of theological topics primarily through the use of the tools and methods of philosophical reasoning and information gained from nature and reason ("general revelation") apart from the Bible.</p>

<p><b>Practical theology</b> &#8211; The study of how to best apply theological truths to the life of the church and the world (including preaching, Christian education, counseling, evangelism, missions, church administration, worship, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Apologetics</b> &#8211; The study of theology for the purpose of defending Christian teaching against criticism and distortion, and giving evidences of its credibility.</p>
