<p>Now that we have looked at why we need to study doctrine, and what doctrine is, let's look at how to study doctrine.</p>
<b>With Divine enablement</b>

<ul>
<li><b>By Prayer:</b> Psalm 119:18 &#8211; Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.</li>

<li><b>By the Spirit:</b> 1 Corinthians 2:12 - Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.</li>
</ul>

<b>In purity</b>
<p>Hebrews 6:1 - Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God</p>

<b>With Humility</b>
<p>1 Peter 5:5 - Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."</p>

<b>With the help of others</b>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-13 - And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, 13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,</p>

<b>With hearts of worship</b>
<p>Psalm 119:162 - I rejoice at your word like one who finds great spoil</p>

<b>With a willingness to change</b>
<p>James 1:23-25 - For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. 25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.</p>
