	<li><p><strong>Convictions:</strong> These are central beliefs of the Christian faith that are crucial to salvation.  Examples would include the doctrine of the Trinity, the full deity and humanity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, the authority of the Scripture, etc.  These are issues over which we would eventually divide fellowship with others (if there is no repentance).  The church has historically used the term "heresy" to speak about deviations from these beliefs.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Persuasions:</strong> These are beliefs about which we are personally certain but can still fellowship with other Christians who disagree since they are not matters central to the gospel and/or the historic Christian faith.  Examples of "persuasion" level issues would be forms of church government, appropriate mode of baptism (sprinkling vs. immersion), the age of the earth, the timing of Christ's return, etc.</p>
		<p>NOTE: It is important to recognize that the difference between "convictions" and "persuasions" is not how strongly you believe a certain doctrine but rather what category that doctrine fits in.  You may have a very strong belief that only professing believers should be baptized.  What makes your view of baptism a "persuasion" level doctrine is not the strength of your belief but the nature of this doctrine (i.e., the fact that one's view on this is not central to salvation and that it is a matter on which evangelical Christians who uphold the authority of Scripture differ).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Opinions:</strong> These are beliefs, desires, or even wishes which may not be clearly taught in Scripture or over which believers may legitimately differ.  Implicit in this third category is the assumption that there may be more than one correct "Christian" view on an issue.  An example might, "How should Christians educate their children (home school, public school or Christian school)?" Another might be, "Which is the best Bible translation?"</p></li>

<p>This helps further clarify the orientation of the Statement of Faith.  Look at the second paragraph: </p>
<blockquote>We accept those areas of doctrinal teaching on which, historically, there has been general agreement among all true Christians <em><strong>[These are conviction-level issues]</strong></em>. Because of the specialized calling of our movement, we desire to allow for freedom of conviction on other doctrinal matters <em><strong>[These represent persuasions and opinions]</strong></em>, provided that any interpretation is based upon the Bible alone, and that no such interpretation shall become an issue which hinders the ministry to which God has called us.</blockquote>
<p>Our Statement of Faith is orientated toward the conviction-level issues.</p>
