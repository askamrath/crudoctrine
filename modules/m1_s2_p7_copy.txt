<p>In the modules that follow we will examine each of the seventeen points in our Statement of Faith.  This module will focus on the second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><em>We accept those areas of doctrinal teaching on which, historically, there has been general agreement among all true Christians. Because of the specialized calling of our movement, we desire to allow for freedom of conviction on other doctrinal matters, provided that any interpretation is based upon the Bible alone, and that no such interpretation shall become an issue which hinders the ministry to which God has called us.</em></blockquote>
<p>As you look at the CCC Statement of Faith, you may wonder why we have chosen to include the items listed here.  The second paragraph provides an important clue: "We accept those areas of doctrinal teaching on which, historically, there has been general agreement among all true Christians."  In other words, our Statement of Faith is orientated to the <em>essentials</em> of the Christian faith (e.g., the Trinity, Jesus Christ as fully human and fully God, salvation by grace alone through faith alone, the person and work of the Holy Spirit, the Scriptures at the Word of God, etc.)</p>
<p>The items contained in our Statement of Faith would be affirmed by the vast majority of conservative evangelical Christians regardless of whether they are Baptists, Presbyterians, Nazarenes, Bible Church, Free Church, etc.</p>

<p>If you look carefully, you will notice that there are a number of questions that are not addressed by our Statement of Faith:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the appropriate form of church government?</li>
<li>Should women be ordained in the church?</li>
<li>Who should be baptized (infants or only believers)?</li>
<li>How should baptism be administered?</li>
<li>How should the Lord's Supper be observed?</li>
<li>Did Christ die for all the sins of all people or only for the elect?</li>
<li>Does the Holy Spirit bestow miraculous gifts today?</li>
<li>Is it right for Christians to participate in war?</li>
<li>How does God's providence relate to human freedom?</li>
<li>Was the earth created in six solar days or over a long period time?</li>
<li>How old is the universe?</li>
<li>When will Christ return?</li>
<li>Will there are a literal 1000 year millennium preceding Christ's return?</li>
<li>Will the church be spared from the great tribulation?</li>
<li>What is the best Bible translation?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is in keeping with the unique calling of Campus Crusade for Christ as an evangelistic arm of church. Within the context of our Statement of Faith, we partner with a broad cross-section of the Christian community.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that our Statement of Faith distinguishes central doctrines of the Christian faith ("those areas of doctrinal teaching on which, historically, there has been general agreement among all true Christians") from "other doctrinal matters" where "freedom of conviction" is allowed.  This distinction is really important.  It has at least three implications for your work with Campus Crusade for Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it means that <em>you are free, as a staff member, to hold theological positions on matters that are not addressed by our Statement of Faith provided</em>
<ol type="a">
<li>that your views are "based upon the Bible alone" and</li>
<li>that this doctrinal issue does not "become an issue which hinders the ministry to which God has called us."</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Second, it may mean that <em>you are going to serve alongside people on your team who hold differing theological views on issues not addressed by our Statement of Faith</em>.  It is important to recognize that your teammates have the same freedom of opinion you do on secondary matters.  You may differ with a teammate on several of the questions listed above.  They need to experience from you the same freedom you have been granted.</li>
<li>Third, because of the value that CCC places on partnering with various churches and ministries (both locally and globally) on the one hand, we highly value partnering with other ministries that hold to the historic doctrinal statements included in our Statement of Faith.  On the other hand, <em>you are free to partner with those who hold different positions on secondary matters not addressed by our Statement of Faith</em>.</li>
</ul>
